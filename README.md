# Cloud-Project-101
Semester 5 Project : Serverless Resume Parser and Job Notifier 
Project Overview
This project is an event-driven serverless application built on AWS, designed to meet the requirements of a cloud computing assignment. The application provides a simple web interface for candidates to upload resumes and for an HR user to post new job openings. The backend automatically parses resumes for skills and notifies matching candidates when a relevant job is posted.

The application provides a web-based frontend with two distinct user roles:

Candidate: Can upload their resume (in PDF or image format).

HR User: Can log in to a protected section to post new job openings.

The backend is a decoupled, event-driven system where an S3 upload triggers a workflow that uses AI services to parse the resume, stores the structured data in a NoSQL database, and automatically matches and notifies candidates when a relevant job is posted.

Architecture Overview
Core AWS Services Used (7)
Amazon S3: For secure storage of resume files. Triggers the parsing process upon file upload.

AWS Lambda: The core of the serverless compute logic, used for all backend processing tasks.

Amazon API Gateway: Provides a secure and scalable RESTful API endpoint for the frontend to interact with the backend.

Amazon DynamoDB: A fully managed NoSQL database used to store structured data for candidates and jobs.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service): Acts as a message broker to decouple the job posting process from the notification process.

Amazon Textract: An AI service that automatically extracts text and data from uploaded resume documents (PDFs/images).

Amazon CloudWatch: Used for real-time logging, monitoring, and debugging of all Lambda functions.

Security Considerations
Security is implemented at multiple layers of the application:

IAM Roles: Each Lambda function operates under an IAM role with the principle of least privilege. Permissions are narrowly scoped to only the specific actions and resources the function needs (e.g., the AddJobRole can only write to the JobsTable and publish to a specific SNS topic).

S3 Bucket Security: The S3 bucket is configured to Block all public access. Files are uploaded securely using temporary, time-limited presigned URLs generated by the GetUploadURLFunction.

API Gateway: Serves as a secure entry point, managing traffic and access to the backend Lambda functions.

Frontend: A simple password-based login protects the HR section from public access.
Setup and Deployment
To deploy this application, follow the detailed steps outlined in the project documentation. The high-level steps include:

Foundation Setup: Create the S3 bucket, DynamoDB tables, and SNS topic.

IAM Roles: Create the four specific IAM roles with their custom inline policies.

Lambda Deployment: Deploy the four Python functions and configure their environment variables and triggers (S3, SNS).

API Gateway: Build the REST API with two POST endpoints and a manual CORS configuration.

Frontend Configuration: Update the API_ENDPOINT constant in the index.html file with the deployed API Gateway's Invoke URL.
